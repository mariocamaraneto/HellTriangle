## Optimized

This solution don't test every possible of sum. 
Use strategy of sum from down to top avoiding that the program make calculations unnecessary.

Verify from down of triangle what numbers is bigger and sum with above line. 

The complexity is O(n^2) that is less than brute force O(2^n).

In this case, the route used in the sum of numbers isn't save.
